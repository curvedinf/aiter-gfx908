"""FlyDSL Linear Attention Prefill K5 host wrapper (gated delta rule).

This module hosts ``chunk_gated_delta_rule_fwd_h_flydsl`` -- the host
wrapper around the K5 hidden-state recurrence FlyDSL kernel
(``compile_chunk_gated_delta_h``). It performs PyTorch tensor
preparation, chooses ``BV`` with a rule-based grid/CU heuristic, manages
the compiled kernel cache, and handles the launch stream. The kernel-
compile module ``kernels.chunk_gated_delta_h`` is kept ``torch``-free,
mirroring the layering used by ``kernels.gdr_decode``.

For an end-to-end GDN forward that uses this K5 wrapper, call
``aiter.ops.triton.gated_delta_net.chunk_gated_delta_rule_opt_vk`` with
``use_chunk_flydsl=True``.

# The flyc launcher requires every tensor argument to be an ``fx.Tensor``
# (``None`` is not accepted), and the K5 kernel reads the offset arrays as
# int32 (``GTensor(..., dtype=T.i32, ...)``). The Triton-side cached prologue
# helpers (``prepare_chunk_offsets`` / ``prepare_rebased_cu_seqlens``) return
# int64, so the launch path was previously doing ``.to(torch.int32)`` on
# every forward, even though the underlying int64 tensor is identity-stable
# across forwards thanks to ``@tensor_cache``. We sidestep that by:
#
#   1. ``_as_int32``: attaches the int32 view directly onto the int64 tensor
#      as a private attribute (``Tensor`` objects accept arbitrary
#      attributes). The first forward casts once; every subsequent forward
#      is a pure ``getattr`` -- no ATen op dispatch, no allocator hit, no
#      D2D copy. Lifetime is bound to the int64 tensor itself, so when the
#      upstream ``@tensor_cache`` evicts an entry the int32 copy is freed
#      automatically (no ``id``-recycling hazard, unlike a global dict).
#
#   2. ``_get_dummy``: per-device cached scalar tensors for the
#      ``cu_seqlens is None`` (batched) path. The original code allocated a
#      fresh ``torch.empty(1, dtype=fp32)`` plus two ``dummy.to(int32)``
#      casts on every call; those are pure overhead because the kernel never
#      reads them when ``IS_VARLEN=False``. We hand back a single shared
#      tensor per (device, dtype) instead.

    Signature is API-compatible with
    ``aiter.ops.triton._triton_kernels.gated_delta_rule.prefill.chunk_delta_h.chunk_gated_delta_rule_fwd_h_opt_vk``:

    Args:
        k: [B, T, Hg, K] bf16.
        w: [B, H, T_flat, K] bf16, head-major contiguous layout.
        u: [B, H, T_flat, V] bf16, head-major contiguous layout.
        g: [B, H, T_total] f32 cumulative gate, head-major contiguous
            (matches Triton VK / HIP K5), or None. Must be a
            ``contiguous()`` tensor with stride-1 along the T dimension.
            Caller passes ``g`` in natural-log space; when
            ``use_exp2=True`` the K1+K2 producer is expected to have
            already pre-scaled ``g`` by ``log2(e)`` (i.e. ``g`` is in
            log2 space) -- this matches the Triton VK convention and is
            NOT re-scaled by this wrapper.
        gk: [T_total, H, K] f32 per-K cumulative gate (natural-log
            space), or None. Pre-scaled to log2 space inside the wrapper
            when ``use_exp2=True``, mirroring
            ``chunk_gated_delta_rule_fwd_h_opt_vk``.
        initial_state: [N, H, V, K] f32, or None.
        output_final_state: whether to return the final hidden state.
        chunk_size: chunk size BT (default 64).
        save_new_value: whether to materialize ``v_new``.
        cu_seqlens: [N+1] LongTensor for variable-length batching, or None.
        state_dtype: optional initial/final state dtype (float32 or bfloat16).
        use_exp2: whether ``g`` is in log2 space. Standalone K5 callers pass
            natural-log ``g`` by default; end-to-end prefill passes the Triton
            K1 ``use_exp2`` setting through explicitly.
        num_decodes: number of leading decode-only sequences to skip in
            ``cu_seqlens``. When nonzero, ``cu_seqlens`` is the ORIGINAL,
            cache-stable metadata tensor (decode prefix included) and the
            data tensors (``k/w/u/g/...``) are expected to be pre-sliced to
            the prefill region; the offsets are rebased internally via the
            cached ``prepare_rebased_cu_seqlens``.
        num_decode_tokens: number of leading decode tokens stripped from the
            data tensors; subtracted from the rebased offsets so they index
            from token 0 of the prefill region.

    Returns:
        (h, v_new, final_state) in VK-ordered layout (``[..., V, K]`` on the
        last two dims).

    BV-tile selection is rule-based. ``chunk_gdn_h_tuned.csv`` remains an AOT
    seed list for pre-compilation, but runtime BV selection does not read it.
